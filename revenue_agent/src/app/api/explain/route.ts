- **Historical Average**: ₹${activeContext.forecast?.historical_avg_lakh || 38.5} Lakh/week
- **ML Baseline Model (XGBoost)**: Forecasts **₹${activeContext.forecast?.ml_forecast_8_weeks_avg_lakh || 41.2} Lakh/week** over the next 8 weeks based on seasonal ordering patterns and lead times.
- **AI Scenario-Adjusted Forecast**: **₹${activeContext.forecast?.ai_scenario_forecast_lakh || 39.8} Lakh/week** (-3.4% variance), accounting for recent steel price surcharges and payment collection lags.

Key drivers influencing our weekly revenue performance:

1. **Customer Order Volume (+14.2% Positive Driver)**: High machine utilization across CNC milling cells boosts overall billings.
2. **Steel Cost Volatility (-4.2% Drag)**: Raw material price hikes in Peenya clusters reduce net operating margin.
3. **Accounts Receivable Delay (-2.8% Drag)**: Payment delays over 30 days restrict cash liquidity buffer.

**Recommendation**: Maintain high machine uptime while accelerating payment follow-ups for high-delay clients.`;

- **Steel Price Trends**: Domestic mild steel quotes in Bengaluru Peenya clusters have risen **+4%**, threatening component gross margins.
- **EV Industry Transition**: Growing demand for aluminum battery housings provides a diversification opportunity for precision CNC machining.
- **Power Outage Risks**: Scheduled Karnataka power grid maintenance may disrupt shop floor shift schedules.

**Advisory**: Lock in 60-day raw material supplier contracts to shield against short-term price spikes.`;

Synthesizing internal sales records and external market indicators:

1. **Margin Defense**: Initiate a **+3.4% surcharge** on steel-intensive product lines.
2. **Cash Flow Optimization**: Follow up on delayed invoices to reduce average collection cycle from 24 days to under 15 days.
3. **Capacity Utilization**: Reallocate low-margin CNC lathe time to high-precision aerospace and EV component orders.`;
